# Graphing-Utility-API Not done YETTTT
A simple Graphing Utility API that is used for graphing and finding input/output of equations. Feel free to use as a homework helper in case you're unable to use Desmos. Note: It is not finished so there are still bugs.

How to use:

To create a Function grapher object, type <objectnamegoeshere> = FunctionGrapher(argument1, argument2).
  
Argument 1 and Argument Two will be two lists of coefficients of x and their corresponding exponents.
  
i.e. FunctionGrapher([1,2,3], [3,2,1]) would create the equation: x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x.

To find the output of any input, type the object name, then a period, and then output(argument1), where argument 1 will be the x value you want to plug in.
  
To graph the function, type the object name, then a period, then turtlegraph(startinterval, endinterval).
 
Your start interval will be the x value you want to start graphing from, and your end interval will be where you want to stop graphing.

Thank you for using my function grapher!
